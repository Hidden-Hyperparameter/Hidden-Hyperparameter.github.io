卡多了没事干

## Interpolate between Diffusion and FM design space

就是做 ablations....

1. Continuous or Discrete: 连续的时间更好

2. Model parameterization: weighted score model (预测噪声) > 预测速度场 > score model

3. Interpolant: Linear < GVP ($\alpha_t=\cos(\pi t/2), \sigma_t=\sin(\pi t/2)$)

4. Noise in sampling? have noise is better

## Improve network architecture
